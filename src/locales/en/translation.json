      "text": "Father was sitting under the warm sun, in the shade of a tree. The children sat around him in a circle, listening closely.\n— One day, — Father was saying, — a clever fox came down from the mountains. He had a long and fluffy tail.\nHe didn’t have time to finish. A noise was heard from the edge of the village. A hen screamed, and feathers flew into the air.\n— The fo-o-ox! — shouted one boy, — it’s in the henhouse!\nThe children ran toward the coop, and Father followed them.\nAnd there they saw how the fox was trying skillfully to steal a hen.\nFather began to sing with a smile, but in a serious tone:\n“The fox came down the hill,\nWith little shorty legs still…”\nThe children, excited, joined the song — but they were determined to keep the fox away."
